## Installation

### Build Documentation

### Tree Models

To get you started, you can download [LumenRT Tree Models](https://hub.arcgis.com/content/e49b1fb0f56e40c19ff6e7ad4e546dad/about) or buy model-packs from [Laubwerk](htpps://laubwerk.com).

## Usage

See scripts in `examples`.

## Further Notes

The ESRI CityEngine uses Jython 2.7 as its Python interpreter. Following from this, all modules and scripts need to conform to the Python 2.7 syntax.
While importing modules other than those bundled with Python 2.7 should be possible by manipulating the `sys.path` variable, the resulting package might
become unstable/harder to deal with.
